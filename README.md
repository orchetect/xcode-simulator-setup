# xcode-simulator

This action is intended to dynamically find the best available pre-installed Xcode device simulator for macOS images in GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

Relevant Xcode device simulator names and platform versions are an ever-moving hamster wheel. In order to maintain GitHub Actions CI pipelines across dozens of open-source repositories, over the years I have gradually tweaked and refined scripts to aid in this process. 

Over time, numerous quirks and edge cases of both GitHub actions runners and how Xcode behaves has led to a laundry list of steps involved in successfully preparing a device simulator for use on runners.

This acton is designed as a one-stop shop to select and prepare a device simulator, primarily with the intention of running unit tests on the simulator.

## Parameters

| Name             | Required | Description                                                  | Format                       |

| `refresh`        | No       | Refresh Xcode simulators by first calling the simulator controller to refresh by listing all local simulators. | `true` or `false`            |
| `download`       | No       | Asks the simulator controller to first download a relevant simulator for the platform specified by the target parameter. | `true` or `false`            |
| `workspace-path` | No       | Relative path to the Xcode workspace. If the target is a Swift Package that exists in the root of the repository, omit this parameter. | Relative path from repo root |
| `scheme`         | Yes      | Xcode scheme name that will be used when enumerating available device simulators. | String                       |
| `target`         | Yes      | Target identifier (case-insensitive). See table below for full list of identifiers. | String                       |
| `os-version`     | No       | Platform OS version (regular expression).                    | String                       |

## Usage

Prepare an iOS device simulator (defaults to iPhone) using the latest device and operating system version in order to test a Swift Package:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: orchetect/xcode-simulator@main
      with:
        scheme: MySchemeName
        target: iOS
```

Prepare an iOS device simulator (defaults to iPhone) using the latest device and operating system version in order to test an Xcode project named `MyProject.xcodeproj` located within the `MyProject` folder:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: orchetect/xcode-simulator@main
      with:
        workspace-path: MyProject/MyProject.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace
        scheme: MySchemeName
        target: iOS
```

Prepare an iOS device simulator using the latest iPhone Pro Max device running iOS 26.2:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: orchetect/xcode-simulator@main
      with:
        scheme: MySchemeName
        target: iphone-pro-max
        os-version: 26.2
```

## Complete Examples

Prepare an iOS device simulator (defaults to iPhone) using the latest device and operating system version in order to test a Swift Package:

> [!TIP]
>
> Separating the build and test phases into separate steps is recommended for organization and clarity.
>
> Building (unlike testing) typically does not require a simulator destination and a generic destination can be supplied.

```yaml
env:
  SCHEME: "MySchemeName"
  WORKSPACEPATH: ".swiftpm/xcode/package.xcworkspace" # Standard workspace location for Swift Package
  
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@main
    - name: Prepare Device Simulator
      id: prep-sim
      uses: orchetect/xcode-simulator@main
      with:
        refresh: true
        download: true
        scheme: ${{ env.SCHEME }}
        target: iOS
    - name: Build
      run: |
        xcodebuild build \
          -workspace "$WORKSPACEPATH" \
          -scheme "$SCHEME" \
          -destination "generic/platform=iOS"
    - name: Unit Test
      run: |
        xcodebuild test \
          -workspace "$WORKSPACEPATH" \
          -scheme "$SCHEME" \
          -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$DESTID"
      env:
        DESTID: ${{ steps.prep-sim.outputs.id }}
